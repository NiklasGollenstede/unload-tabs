<b>BUGS</b>:
Firefox currently suffers from a number of bugs related to unloading tabs. Most notably, tabs may <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1450382">lose their icons</a> or <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1450371">display as loading</a>. Fixing that is Mozilla's job.
If you encounter any <b>other</b> problems, please report them as an <a href="https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/unload-tabs/issues">issue</a> or comment on an existing issue matching your problem. Please don't complain in a rating on the Add-ons download page. I can't respond to those.

<b>Permissions used</b>:<ul>
	<li> <b>Display notifications</b>: Only to report errors </li>
	<li> <b>Access browser tabs</b>: This should be pretty obvious </li>
</ul>


## Development builds -- ![](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/NiklasGollenstede/unload-tabs?svg=true)

Development builds are automatically created on every commit with [appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NiklasGollenstede/unload-tabs/history) and [released](https://github.com/NiklasGollenstede/epub-creator/releases) on GitHub.\
These builds use a different id (`-dev` suffix), so they are installed as an additional extension and do not replace the release version. This means that:
 * you probably want to disable the release version while the development version is active
 * any options set are managed individually (so pre-release versions can't mess with your settings)
 * they never update to release versions, but
    * they update themselves to the latest development version
    * every release version has a corresponding development version (the one with the same prefix and highest build number)
